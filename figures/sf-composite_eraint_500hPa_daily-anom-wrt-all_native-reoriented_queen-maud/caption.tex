\label{fig:queen_maud}
Composite mean 500 hPa specific humidity anomaly for days where a CMMT event (skirting or otherwise) was identified for the Queen Maud Land region. Gray streamlines indicate the direction of the composite mean wind, while the black contours show the composite mean streamfunction anomaly (dashed contours indicate negative values and the contour interval is $1.0 \times 10^6 \: m^2 s^{-1}$). There are 612 (annual), 129 (DJF), 124 (MAM), 151 (JJA) and 208 (SON) days included in each composite respectively.
